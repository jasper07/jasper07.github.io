		<p>I am currently in China on a working holiday. Today is Chinese New Year, a time to be retrospective and a second chance for me to start acting on some resolutions that slipped.</p>

<p>My observation is China is a contrast in technology trends, mobile adoption is moving faster than anywhere else I have been and in the wake a legacy of Windows XP on the desktop is refusing to go away.</p>

<p>Everywhere you look you see Iphone 6s and Galaxy Note 3s, prior to coming to China I knew that &ldquo;brand new&rdquo; mobile phones were fashionable, and I discounted as a younger generation fascinated with status and Western Culture. Being here has given me a different perspective. Not having access to sites like Google, YouTube or Facebook has not slowed down adoption of technology, from what I can see China is ahead of the curve when it comes to mobility, both in terms of adoption and how the mobile device is being used.</p>

<p>The stats are amazing <a href="http://www.hihuadu.com/2015/02/03/chinese-mobile-phone-users-to-557-million-or-858-of-total-internet-users-11116.html">Chinese mobile phone users to 557 million or 85.8 % of total Internet users</a>, there is 94.5% mobile penetration and from what I can see, like their cars, they are all brand new and better than mine!</p>

<p>The recent article form Smashing Magazine <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/02/13/china-web-design-trends-2015/">China’s Bleeding Edge: Web Design Trends 2015</a> is a really good read and highlights some of what I am seeing here <b>WeChat, light apps and QR codes</b> everywhere. WeChat is by far the most popular Mobile application with over 400 million users, interestingly around 20% of those users are not based in China. WeChat is more of a one stop mobile platform, it is functionally rich, covering all social media, search, news, blogging, e-commerce, banking, IM, Group Chat needs and more. What makes WeChat interesting to me is that it is self contained with its own web browser, given the popularity of mobility and WeChat in particular it has meant that the way websites are built has changed. To cater for the mobile first, site use the &ldquo;light apps&rdquo; are single page HTML5 app paradigm first. The other thing worth noting is URL&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t shared, instead they use QR Codes everywhere, in shop windows, on products, on billboards etc. QR Codes might have limitations, but that has not stopped the widespread adoption in China. You no longer access a website by entering a URL in the address bar in your browser.</p>

<p>On the flip side of this mobile first adoption is that it is leaving behind an aging desktop legacy. I am lead to believe based on observations and recent articles that the number one desktop OS here in China is still Windows XP. This is no surprise to me, many people probably don&rsquo;t own a desktop or laptop, opting for mobile phones and tablets. Interestingly the majority of big clients and Government agencies I work for are also still predominantly using Windows XP, I guess holding off till it hurts, deferring to a BYOD strategy for certain use cases. However the trend I see in Australia is the adoption of Google Chrome for XP, its the proverbial lipstick on a pig, you can deploy a nice looking HTML5 UI but the UX still sucks. This trend will change as Microsoft is dropping support of XP soon, I believe it is April 2015, around about that time Google has said they will no longer support Chrome for XP also.</p>

<p>The stats say there is a large Chrome user base China, however from what I can see here in China based on my own access, using Chrome on XP is probably not an option and this uptake may come from Android devices where Chrome is pre-installed. I am not reading or seeing any uptake for browsers like Firefox and Opera either. <a href="https://www.modern.ie/en-us/ie6countdown">Modern.ie</a> shows whilst dropping rapidly, 3% of China still uses IE6 for a browser and of the remaining 10% that makes up the Desktop portion aging IE browsers rule, given the number of internet users those numbers whilst low in percentage are very scary. This definitely presents a technical challenge for Enterprise Software or start-up companies thinking of breaking into China and i am sure there are many who want to. Continue to support IE8, with ES6 and HTTP2 round the corner that is a massive overhead. Or hope that users will only want to use you apps on the web kit/chrome browser on their phone. Or goto where the users are, redesign mobile first, break out the QR codes and install the WeChat SDK. I think Smashing Magazine article says it all &ldquo;Do <del>China</del> Mobile right or don’t bother&rdquo;.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A couple of weeks ago I was playing around with SAP HCP Trial WebIDE and noticed that the Fiori sample applications were using the MockServer for all OData Entity requests and also for the custom OData Function Imports.</p>

<p>This week I had a requirement to create a simple Function Import, the function calls the backend SAP system to determine whether or not to show a button, I used as an opportunity to investigate and learn how to add my own mock xhr request to the SAPUI5 Mockserver and thought I would share.</p>

<p>To add your own requests to a MockServer instance is quite simple, first set up the MockServer, retrieve the current requests, then add your request and then set the updated requests back to Mockerver.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript"><code>//initialize the MockServer as per normal
jQuery.sap.require("sap.ui.core.util.MockServer");
var oMockServer = new sap.ui.core.util.MockServer({
    rootUri: sServiceUrl
});
oMockServer.simulate("model/metadata.xml", "model/");
 
//add your requests to the ones already set 
try {
  jQuery.sap.require("myapp.model.mockRequests");
  var aMyRequests = myapp.model.mockRequests.getRequests();
  if (aMyRequests.length > 0) {
    oMockServer.setRequests(oMockServer.getRequests().concat(aMyRequests));
  }
} catch (oErr) {
  jQuery.sap.log.debug(oErr.message);
}
 
//start the mockserver
oMockServer.start();
</code></pre>


<p>The documentation for <a href="https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.core.util.MockServer.html#setRequests">UI5 MockServer setRequests</a> gives a good explanation on the structure of requests</p>

<blockquote><p>method : &#8220;GET&#8221;|&#8221;POST&#8221;|&#8221;DELETE|&#8221;PUT&#8221; <br/>path : &#8220;/path/to/resource&#8221;<br/>response : function(xhr, param1, param2, &#8230;) { }</p></blockquote>


<p>Here is the code I wrote for the ShowAddButton Mock call</p>

<pre class="language-javascript"><code>sap.ui.define(['jquery.sap.global'],
    function(jQuery) {
        "use strict";
        var mockRequests = {
            /**
             * This mock determines whether the '+' add button should be shown
             */
            mockShowAddButton: function() {
                return {
                    method: "GET",
                    path: new RegExp("ShowAddButton?(.*)"), 
                    response: function(oXhr, sUrlParams) {
                        jQuery.sap.log.debug("Incoming request for ShowAddButton");
                        oXhr.respondJSON(200, {}, JSON.stringify({
                            d: {
                                ShowAddButton: true
                            }
                        }));
                    }
                };
            },
            /**
             * get requests
             * @return {array} Array of mock request
             */
            getRequests: function() {
                return [mockRequests.mockShowAddButton()];
            }
        };
        return mockRequests;
    },
    true);
</code></pre>

<p>A few people have asked me to share the slides from the talk I gave at SAP DCode 2014 Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The talk was aimed at developers who had already started writing SAPUI5 apps, the objective was to highlight a variety of patterns, principles and best practices to help them take their development to the next level.</p>

<p>The takeaway points</p>

<p><strong>1. Follow JS Best Practices</strong> - a lot of the tutorials and documentation for SAPUI5 is centred around using Eclipse as an IDE, in my opinion which is shared by many others there is &ldquo;no one size fits all&rdquo;, to get the right developer workflow it is better to build your JS developer toolchain from the ground up, that way you get to know what works and why. Start by investigating how developers using other JS toolkits and frameworks set up theirs, experiment, add the additional functionality as it is needed rather than start with something that is preconfigured and abstracts away the detail making it hard to change. The best practices section covered things like the need for automating repetitive develop, build and deploy tasks using Grunt, using a distributed version control system like git to reduce the risk of introducing errors, and ensuring the quality of the code pushed back to SAP is always production ready, also covered was following Web development best practices to reduce the complexity and improve the performance of your apps etc.</p>

<p><strong>2. Don’t Build Big Apps</strong> - this is true for any programming paradigm, don’t build big apps, build lots of small ones, wire them together with events. In this section I covered the different techniques available for modularizing your code into smaller units, and then how to bring the small units together using techniques like routing, which enable you to set up the state of the application from the URL, i.e. what views need to be visible and what data needs to be shown and then how to use events to seamlessly navigate to different states of the application.</p>

<p><strong>3. Use fit-for-purposes API&rsquo;s</strong> - the inside-out approach for creating services with Netweaver Gateway sounds like a good idea, take an existing BAPI and expose it. This approach lends itself to complexity, BAPI’s are normally quite complex to start with, they have to cater for lots of different scenarios, as you come across business logic and functionality not available in the BAPI developers will often try workarounds and build the logic into the front end, you should let the data drive the application not the other way around. In this section I talked about the advantages of taking a mock model first approach. Flesh out the screens you have designed and build an information architecture. Use this as a basis for a data model to build your Gateway services. Once you have modelled your services you can easily generate mock data for the service, this will allow UI5 developers to quickly build the shell of the application and validate the completeness of the data model. Other benefits of using mock data first are that developments can happen in parallel, different parts of the UI can be developed independent of other UI and backend ABAP developments. Using the MockData Server makes it easy to create Unit and End-to-End tests allowing you to quickly find issues, perfect for quickly validating new feature request and changes made during bug fixes.</p>

<p>The Fiori 1:1:3 mantra whilst an over simplification was a very timely reminder to keep UI design simple, the same thinking should be applied to development and how we develop, regardless of the size of apps we are building, one size does not fit all, keep things simple and fit for purpose.</p>
